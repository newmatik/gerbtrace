# Spaces

![Spaces list page showing team spaces](/images/docs/team-spaces-overview.png)

Spaces let you partition a team's projects and packages into separate workgroups. Use them to organize work by customer, product line, department, or any other grouping that makes sense for your team.

## Creating a space

Navigate to **Team > Spaces** from the sidebar. Admins can click **New Space** to create one. Enter a name (up to 15 characters) and confirm. The new space appears in the list sorted alphabetically.

## Managing a space

Click a space card to open its detail page. Admins can:

- **Rename** the space by editing the name inline (up to 15 characters)
- **Add a description** (up to 500 characters) to explain the space's purpose
- **Delete** the space using the delete button

## Space members

The Members section lists all team members. Admins can add or remove members from the space using the **Add** / **Remove** button next to each member. Only members assigned to a space can see the projects and packages scoped to it.

## Guest invitations

Admins can invite external users as guests by entering their email address in the **Invite Guest** section. The invitation is sent via email and expires after 7 days. Pending invitations are listed below the invite form.

Guests have the **Guest** role, which restricts access to only the spaces they have been invited to. See [Team Members](/docs/collaboration/team-members) for the full role breakdown.

## Assigning projects to spaces

On the [home page](/), team projects can be assigned to a space using the space dropdown on each project card. Projects assigned to a space are only visible to that space's members and guests. Projects without a space assignment remain visible to all team members.

When creating a new team project, you can assign it to a space directly from the create dialog.

## Space-scoped packages

The [Package Manager](/docs/tools/package-manager) supports a space scope toggle. When viewing a space's packages, you can copy built-in or team packages into the space. Space packages are available only to that space's members. See [Package Manager](/docs/tools/package-manager) for details.
