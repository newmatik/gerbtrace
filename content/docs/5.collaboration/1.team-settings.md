# Team Settings

![Team Settings page showing the General tab](/images/docs/team-general.png)

The Team Settings page is accessible from the **Settings** menu (gear icon). Only team admins can modify these settings. The page is organized into tabs accessible from the sidebar: **Spaces**, **General**, **Defaults**, **Integrations**, and **Members**.

## General

### Team name

The display name for your team, shown in the header and project listings.

### Subdomain

A unique slug for your team URL (e.g., `yourteam.gerbtrace.com`). Subdomains cannot be changed after creation.

### Auto-join domain

An email domain (e.g., `newmatik.com`) that allows users to automatically join the team when they sign up with a matching email address.

## Defaults

![Team Settings Defaults tab showing currency, time format, and panel defaults](/images/docs/team-defaults.png)

### Default currency

Choose **EUR** or **USD**. BOM prices are converted and displayed in this currency across all projects.

### Clock format

Choose **24-hour** or **12-hour (AM/PM)** time format. This controls how timestamps are displayed across the team.

### Panel defaults

Configure default panel dimensions used by the [Panel](/docs/viewer/panel) suggestion engine:

- **Preferred Width / Height** – target panel size for suggestions (mm)
- **Maximum Width / Height** – hard limit that triggers size warnings (mm)

These values are used when clicking **Generate** in the Panel tab.

## Integrations

![Team Settings Integrations tab showing Elexess and Spark AI configuration](/images/docs/team-integrations.png)

### Elexess

Configure the Elexess API for [BOM](/docs/viewer/bom) pricing integration. The Elexess API provides live distributor pricing data (stock, MOQ, unit price) from multiple suppliers.

- **Enable** toggle – activate or deactivate the integration
- **Username** and **Password** – your Elexess API credentials
- **Test Connection** – validates the credentials and shows a Connected / Failed status

Once configured, the **Fetch Prices** button in the BOM tab retrieves pricing for all lines with manufacturer part numbers.

### Spark AI

Configure Spark AI for [BOM](/docs/viewer/bom) enrichment. Spark uses the Anthropic Claude API to suggest improvements for BOM line descriptions, component types, classifications, manufacturers, and group assignments.

- **Enable** toggle – activate or deactivate AI enrichment
- **Anthropic API Key** – your API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
- **Model** – select the AI model (Sonnet or Haiku)
- **Test Connection** – validates the API key

Once configured, the sparkles button in the BOM toolbar triggers AI enrichment for all lines. See [BOM](/docs/viewer/bom#spark-ai-enrichment) for details on how suggestions work.
