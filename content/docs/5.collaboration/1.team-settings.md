# Team Settings

![Team Settings page](/images/docs/team-settings.png)

The Team Settings page is accessible from the **Settings** menu (gear icon). Only team admins can modify these settings.

## Team name

The display name for your team, shown in the header and project listings.

## Subdomain

A unique slug for your team URL (e.g., `yourteam.gerbtrace.com`). Subdomains cannot be changed after creation.

## Auto-join domain

An email domain (e.g., `newmatik.com`) that allows users to automatically join the team when they sign up with a matching email address.

## Default currency

Choose **EUR** or **USD**. BOM prices are converted and displayed in this currency across all projects.

## Panel defaults

Configure default panel dimensions used by the [Panel](/docs/viewer/panel) suggestion engine:

- **Preferred Width / Height** – target panel size for suggestions
- **Maximum Width / Height** – hard limit that triggers size warnings

These values are used when clicking **Generate** in the Panel tab.

## Elexess API credentials

![Elexess API Credentials section](/images/docs/team-settings-elexess.png)

Configure the Elexess API credentials for [BOM](/docs/viewer/bom) pricing integration. The Elexess API provides live distributor pricing data (stock, MOQ, unit price) from multiple suppliers.

Enter your API key and save. Once configured, the **Fetch Prices** button in the BOM tab will retrieve pricing for all lines with manufacturer part numbers. Credentials are stored securely in the team configuration and used for all pricing requests within the team.
