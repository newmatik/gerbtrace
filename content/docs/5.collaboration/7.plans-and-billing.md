The Free plan is free forever with no credit card required. It is suitable for open-source projects and small teams. The core viewer, compare, BOM, and PnP features are fully available.

## Pro plan

Pro adds Spark AI BOM enrichment, Elexess component pricing, more team members, and additional Spaces. It is designed for professional teams that need integrated pricing and AI assistance in their manufacturing preparation workflow.

## Team plan

Team is built for larger organizations. It includes higher Elexess search limits, unlimited Spaces, a guest role for external collaborators such as contract manufacturers, and priority support.

## Enterprise

For teams that need unlimited members, SSO, SLAs, or custom billing arrangements, contact [hello@gerbtrace.com](mailto:hello@gerbtrace.com?subject=Enterprise%20Plan) to discuss a tailored enterprise plan.

## How to upgrade

1. Open **Team Settings** from the header team selector.
2. Navigate to the **Billing** tab.
3. Click **Upgrade to Pro** or **Upgrade to Team**.
4. Complete the checkout via Stripe.

Your new plan takes effect immediately after payment.

## Managing your subscription

From the Billing tab in Team Settings, paid plans show a **Manage Subscription** button. This opens the Stripe Customer Portal where you can:

- Update your payment method
- View invoices and payment history
- Change or cancel your plan
- Update billing details (name, address, VAT ID)

## Usage limits

Some features are metered on a monthly basis:

- **Elexess Price Search** — Pro plans include 1,000 searches per month; Team plans include 10,000. Usage resets at the start of each calendar month.
- **Spark AI runs** — available on Pro and Team plans. Spark AI uses your own Anthropic API key, so there is no per-run charge from Gerbtrace.

Current usage is displayed in the Billing tab under **Usage Overview**. When a limit is reached, you will see a prompt to upgrade. Existing data and projects are never affected.

## Billing FAQ

**Do I need a credit card to get started?**
No. The Free plan requires no payment details.

**Can I cancel anytime?**
Yes. Downgrade or cancel from the Billing tab at any time. Your plan stays active until the end of the current billing period.

**What payment methods are accepted?**
Gerbtrace uses Stripe for billing. Stripe accepts all major credit and debit cards. Additional methods may be available depending on your region.

**Is there annual billing?**
Not yet. All plans are currently billed monthly.

**What happens if my payment fails?**
Your subscription is marked as past due. You will receive an email from Stripe with a link to update your payment method. If the issue is not resolved, the subscription may be cancelled and your team will revert to the Free plan.
