# Notifications

![Inbox page showing notifications](/images/docs/inbox.png)

The Inbox collects notifications generated by team activity. Access it by clicking the bell icon in the header. An unread count badge appears when you have unread notifications.

## Notification types

| Type | Icon | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Mention** | @ | Someone mentioned you in a project conversation |
| **Approval requested** | Hourglass | A project was submitted for your approval |
| **Approved** | Check | A project you submitted was approved |
| **Changes requested** | Warning | A reviewer requested changes on your project |
| **Project update** | Bell | General status change on a project you are involved in |

## Reading notifications

Each notification card shows:

- **Type icon** and **title**
- **Timestamp**
- **Project name** (when applicable)
- **Open** button to navigate to the source

Unread notifications are highlighted. Clicking **Open** marks the notification as read and navigates to the project conversation.

## Mark as read

- Click **Open** on a notification to mark it as read individually.
- Click **Mark all read** in the header to clear all unread notifications at once.

## Real-time delivery

Notifications arrive in real time. When another team member mentions you or requests approval, the bell icon badge updates immediately without a page reload.
