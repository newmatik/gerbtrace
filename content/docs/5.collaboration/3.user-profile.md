# User Profile

![User profile dropdown menu](/images/docs/user-profile.png)

Click your avatar (initials badge) in the top-right corner to open the user profile dropdown.

## Profile options

The dropdown provides:

- **Your name and email** – displayed at the top of the dropdown
- **Switch team** – if you belong to multiple teams, switch between them
- **Sign out** – log out of your current session

## Team switching

If your account is a member of multiple teams, use the team selector in the header (next to the gear icon) to switch between teams. Each team has its own projects, members, packages, and settings.

## Authentication

Gerbtrace supports multiple sign-in methods:

- **Email and password** – traditional account creation
- **Magic link** – passwordless login via email OTP
- **GitHub OAuth** – sign in with your GitHub account

New accounts require email confirmation. Password reset is available from the login page.
