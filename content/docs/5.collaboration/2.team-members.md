# Team Members

The Team Members page is accessible from the **Settings** menu (gear icon). It shows all current team members and allows admins to manage roles and invitations.

## Member list

Each member card shows:

- **Avatar** (photo or initials)
- **Full name**
- **Email address**
- **Role badge** (admin, editor, viewer, or guest)
- **Actions menu** (three-dot icon) for management

## Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | Full access: manage members, settings, approve projects, reset passwords |
| **Editor** | Create and edit projects, import files, modify BOM/PnP data |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to projects and data |
| **Guest** | Access limited to assigned [Spaces](/docs/collaboration/spaces) only |

## Member management

Admins can perform the following actions from the member's action menu:

- Change member role
- Edit member name
- Reset member password
- Disable or re-enable account
- Remove member from team

## Invitations

Click **Invite** to send an email invitation to a new team member. Enter the email address and select a role. The invitation includes a unique link to join the team. Pending invitations are visible in the member list.

## Auto-join

If an auto-join domain is configured in [Team Settings](/docs/collaboration/team-settings), users signing up with a matching email address are automatically added to the team.
