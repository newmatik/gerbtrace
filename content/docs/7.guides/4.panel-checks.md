# Panel Checks

Before handing a panel design to production, run through this checklist to verify that the configuration is correct and complete.

## Frame and routing continuity

When frame rails are enabled, verify that internal routing channels do not cut through the top, bottom, left, or right frame rails unexpectedly. The frame must remain structurally continuous to support the panel during assembly.

## Routed vs scored separation

Check the separation method for each edge:

- **Routed** — verify that channel geometry and tab bridges are visually continuous. Routing channels should form a complete path between boards, with tabs bridging the gaps.
- **Scored** — verify that V-cut lines align with the intended separation edges. Scored lines must run straight across the full panel dimension.
- **Mixed** — when different edges use different separation methods, check each edge individually to confirm the correct behavior.

## Tab placement

- Confirm tabs are present on all edges that require them.
- Verify tab width is appropriate for the board weight and assembly handling.
- Check that tabs do not overlap with components near the board edge.
- If mouse bite perforation is configured, verify the hole diameter and spacing are consistent.

## Fiducials and tooling holes

- Confirm that frame widths are sufficient where fiducials and tooling holes are placed.
- Verify fiducial positions match your pick-and-place machine requirements.
- Supported fiducial positions: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.
- Check tooling hole diameter and offset from panel edges.

## Component clearance

- Enable the component overlay on the panel view to check for conflicts.
- Verify that no SMD or THT components fall within the danger zone inset.
- Check that components near board edges do not interfere with routing channels or tabs.

## Panel dimensions

- Verify the total panel dimensions (displayed in the status bar).
- Confirm the panel fits within your manufacturer's maximum panel size.
- If a panel size warning appears, resize the grid or adjust frame widths.

## Support bars

- If support bars are enabled, verify they do not interfere with components.
- Check that rail widths are appropriate for structural support.
- Confirm gap placement is correct for any selective gaps.

## Final visual review

- Export a panel preview image.
- Review the complete panel layout on the canvas at full zoom.
- Compare the panel configuration against the manufacturer's specification sheet.
- Verify all settings match before releasing the design.
