# Importing Files

Gerbtrace imports files through the **Files** tab using drag-and-drop or the import button. This guide covers the import workflow, auto-detection behavior, and how to resolve mapping issues.

## Import methods

### ZIP packages

Drop a ZIP file containing Gerber and drill files. Gerbtrace extracts all files and auto-classifies them by layer type. This is the fastest way to import a complete PCB design.

### Individual files

Drop or select individual files. You can import multiple files at once. Each file is classified independently.

### Supported file types

| Category | Extensions |
|---|---|
| **Gerber** | `.gtl`, `.gbl`, `.gts`, `.gbs`, `.gto`, `.gbo`, `.gtp`, `.gbp`, `.gm1`, `.gko`, `.gbr` |
| **Drill** | `.drl`, `.drd`, `.xln`, `.exc`, `.ncd` |
| **Pick and Place** | `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.txt` |
| **BOM** | `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.txt`, `.xlsx`, `.xls` |
| **Documents** | `.pdf` |

See [Supported Formats](/docs/guides/supported-formats) for detailed format specifications.

## Auto-detection

### Gerber and drill files

Layer types are detected from file names and extensions using common naming conventions:

| Pattern | Detected type |
|---|---|
| `.gtl`, `*top*copper*` | Top copper |
| `.gbl`, `*bottom*copper*` | Bottom copper |
| `.gts`, `*top*mask*` | Top solder mask |
| `.gbs`, `*bottom*mask*` | Bottom solder mask |
| `.gto`, `*top*silk*` | Top silkscreen |
| `.gbo`, `*bottom*silk*` | Bottom silkscreen |
| `.gtp`, `*top*paste*` | Top solder paste |
| `.gbp`, `*bottom*paste*` | Bottom solder paste |
| `.drl`, `.xln`, `.exc` | Drill |
| `.gm1`, `.gko`, `*outline*` | Board outline |

Files that cannot be auto-classified appear as **Unmatched** and require manual assignment.

### PnP files

PnP files are recognized by file name keywords (`pnp`, `pick`, `place`, `pos`, `xy`, `centroid`). Column mapping uses header text matching — see [SMD](/docs/viewer/smd) for details.

### BOM files

BOM files are recognized by name keywords (`bom`, `bill-of-materials`, `stückliste`). Column mapping uses header text matching — see [BOM File Format](/docs/reference/bom-format) for the full specification.

### Documents

PDF files are categorized by type. You can assign a document category after import:

- Schematics
- Drawings
- Datasheets
- Instructions

## Import checks

After import, Gerbtrace surfaces warnings when critical manufacturing data is missing or inconsistent:

- **No copper layer detected** — the design has no copper layers
- **No drill layer detected** — no drill files were found
- **No outline detected** — no board outline or keep-out layer
- **Only one outer copper side** — only top or bottom copper present, not both
- **Inner copper mismatch** — configured layer count suggests inner copper layers that are not present

These checks are informational and should be resolved before production handover.

## Manual mapping

### Layer type assignment

If auto-detection assigns the wrong layer type, click the layer in the **Files** panel and select the correct type from the dropdown. Available types include all copper, mask, silk, paste, drill, and outline variants.

### PnP field mapping

If PnP auto-detection fails, a mapping modal appears where you can:

1. See a preview of the first data rows from your file.
2. Assign each required field (designator, X, Y, rotation) to a column.
3. Optionally map additional fields (side, value, package).
4. Configure the header row skip count.

### BOM field mapping

Similarly, if BOM auto-detection fails:

1. Preview the file data.
2. Map fields (references, quantity, description, etc.) to columns.
3. Verify the mapping against the preview.

At least two columns must be successfully matched for auto-detection to succeed. Otherwise, the mapping dialog appears automatically.

## File preview

The **Files** panel includes a table preview for CSV/TSV/Excel files. Click any tabular file to see its contents in a data grid, which helps verify that the correct file was imported and the data looks reasonable before proceeding with mapping.

## PDF documents

Imported PDF files appear in the **Docs** tab. Each document can be:

- Previewed inline
- Downloaded
- Categorized by type
- Removed from the project
