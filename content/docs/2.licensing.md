# Licensing

Gerbtrace is licensed under the [Business Source License 1.1](https://mariadb.com/bsl11/) (BUSL-1.1). This page explains what that means for you.

## Source available, not open source

Gerbtrace is **source available**. The entire source code is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/newmatik/gerbtrace) and anyone can read, study, and modify it. However, the BUSL-1.1 is not an [OSI-approved open-source license](https://opensource.org/osd) because it places one restriction on commercial use: you may not use the code to offer a product that competes with Gerbtrace.

In practice, this distinction matters only if you intend to redistribute the software commercially. For all other uses — internal tooling, learning, contributing — the license is permissive.

## What you can do

- Use Gerbtrace internally within your organization for any purpose, including production.
- Read, study, modify, and learn from the source code.
- Contribute improvements back via pull requests.
- Build internal tools or integrations that use Gerbtrace.

## What you cannot do

- Offer Gerbtrace (or a modified version) to third parties as a competing product or service.
- Rebrand and redistribute Gerbtrace as your own product to customers.
- Embed Gerbtrace in a commercial offering that competes with Gerbtrace.

The license defines a "competitive offering" as a product offered to third parties — whether paid or free — that substantially replicates the functionality of Gerbtrace. Using the software for internal purposes within your organization, including all affiliates under common control, is not considered competitive.

## Automatic relicensing to MIT

Each version of Gerbtrace automatically converts to the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) four years after its release date. This means every release will eventually become fully open source with no restrictions on use.

## Alternative licensing

If the BUSL-1.1 does not fit your use case — for example, if you want to embed Gerbtrace in a commercial product — contact us to discuss an alternative commercial license.
