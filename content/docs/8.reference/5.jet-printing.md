# MY600 Jet Printer – Technical Overview

The **Mycronic MY600** is a high-precision solder paste jet printing system designed for stencil-free PCB assembly. Unlike traditional stencil printing, the MY600 deposits solder paste volumetrically, enabling dynamic, per-pad control of paste volume and geometry within a single print cycle.

## Core principle: Volumetric jet printing

The MY600 uses a piezo-driven ejector to dispense controlled droplets of solder paste onto PCB pads.

Instead of forcing paste through a fixed stencil aperture, the system:

- Ejects controlled micro-droplets
- Calculates required paste volume per pad
- Deposits one or multiple droplets as needed
- Builds final deposit geometry through droplet stacking and placement patterns

This enables precise and flexible solder paste deposition without stencil fabrication.

## Dot size behavior

### Dynamic dot control

The MY600 can change deposit size for every individual pad on the board, in real time, during the same print cycle.

It dynamically adjusts:

- Droplet count per pad
- Droplet volume (within ejector limits)
- Dot spacing
- Stacking pattern (vertical or lateral buildup)

This allows immediate transitions between small and large deposits without hardware changes.

### Standard ejector dot size range

With the standard ejector, typical printed dot diameters are approximately:

- **Minimum:** ~0.33 mm (330 um)
- **Maximum:** ~0.52 mm (520 um)

These values depend on programmed paste volume, jetting height, paste type and rheology, and process settings. For smaller deposits, optional high-resolution ejectors may be available.

### Two levels of "dot size"

It is important to distinguish between:

**Single droplet size** – defined by the ejector type and operating window. Adjustable within limits, but not infinitely variable.

**Final paste deposit size** – fully programmable per pad. Can consist of a single droplet, multiple droplets, stacked droplets, or patterned droplet arrays. Built to match required solder volume precisely.

## Advantages over stencil printing

- No stencil fabrication required
- Instant design change flexibility
- Per-pad volume customization
- Support for mixed-technology boards
- Fine control for prototypes and NPI
- Elimination of step stencil complexity
- On-the-fly optimization capability

## Typical use cases

- Prototyping and small batch production
- Frequent PCB revisions
- Complex mixed-technology boards
- QFN / BGA / center pad optimization
- Low-volume, high-mix production
- Stencil cost reduction strategies

## Process considerations

Performance depends on:

- Paste rheology
- Environmental stability
- Jetting height control
- Machine calibration
- Proper volume programming

Repeatability and process capability are typically very high when properly set up.

## Gerbtrace integration

Gerbtrace's [Paste](/docs/viewer/paste) feature includes a jet print mode that simulates the MY600 dot deposition pattern on the board canvas. You can configure dot diameter and spacing to preview paste coverage before programming the machine.
