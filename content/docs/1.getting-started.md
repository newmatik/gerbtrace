# Getting Started

![Gerbtrace homepage with project dashboard](/images/docs/homepage.png)

This guide walks you through installing Gerbtrace and preparing your first PCB project for production.

## Installation

### Web

Visit [gerbtrace.com](https://gerbtrace.com) – no installation required. Everything runs locally in your browser.

### macOS

1. Download the latest `.dmg` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/newmatik/gerbtrace/releases).
2. Open the `.dmg` and drag **Gerbtrace** to your Applications folder.
3. Launch from Applications.

### Windows

1. Download the latest `.msi` or `.exe` installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/newmatik/gerbtrace/releases).
2. Run the installer.
3. Launch Gerbtrace from the Start menu.

The [Desktop App](/docs/app/desktop) checks for updates automatically on launch.

## Create a project

Open the home page and create a new project:

- **New Viewer Project** – for inspecting a single Gerber package
- **New Compare Project** – for comparing two Gerber packages side by side

Name the project based on the assembly or order reference. For team projects, you can assign the project to a [Space](/docs/collaboration/spaces) to scope it to a particular customer or product line. You can also click **Try a Sample** to explore with the built-in Arduino UNO demo files.

## Import data

Use the [Files](/docs/viewer/files) tab to import your data. Drag and drop files or use the import button. Gerbtrace accepts:

- **Gerber + Drill** files (ZIP or individual)
- **Pick and Place** files (CSV/TSV)
- **BOM** files (CSV/Excel)
- **PDF documents** (schematics, drawings, datasheets)

See [Importing Files](/docs/guides/importing-files) for details on auto-detection and field mapping.

## Confirm file classification

After import, verify the auto-detected layer types in the [Files](/docs/viewer/files) tab:

- Copper layers (top, bottom, inner)
- Solder mask (top, bottom)
- Silkscreen (top, bottom)
- Solder paste (top, bottom)
- Drill files
- Board outline / keep-out

Fix any misclassified files by manually assigning the correct layer type.

## Validate board parameters

In the [PCB](/docs/viewer/pcb) tab, confirm:

- **Size X / Size Y** – board dimensions in mm
- **Layer count** – number of copper layers
- **Material** – FR4, IMS Aluminium, Flex (Polyimide), or Rigid-Flex
- **Surface finish** – ENIG, HAL (HASL), or OSP
- **Solder mask color** – green, black, blue, red, white, purple, or brown
- **Copper weight** and **thickness**

These parameters feed into pricing calculations, panel layout, and the assembly summary.

## Validate process data

- In the [SMD](/docs/viewer/smd) and [THT](/docs/viewer/tht) tabs, verify component placement visibility and orientation. Check for unmatched packages and correct any rotation or alignment issues.
- In the [BOM](/docs/viewer/bom) tab, check for missing part metadata and reference mismatches against the PnP data.

## Configure panelization

If your project requires panelization, switch to the [Panel](/docs/viewer/panel) tab:

1. Set the grid layout (columns and rows).
2. Configure frame rails, fiducials, and tooling holes.
3. Add tabs and routing channels.
4. Review the panel canvas for correctness.

See [Panel Checks](/docs/guides/panel-checks) for the full validation checklist.

## Collaborate

For team projects, use [Conversations](/docs/collaboration/conversations) to discuss the project with your team. Mention colleagues with `@` to notify them. Check your [Inbox](/docs/collaboration/notifications) for mentions, approval requests, and status updates.

## Review and export

- Check the [Summary](/docs/viewer/summary) for assembly warnings and component counts.
- Review [Pricing](/docs/viewer/pricing) for cost estimates at your target quantities.
- Use [Exports](/docs/tools/exports) to download images, Gerber packages, PnP data, DXF drawings, and JPSys jet print programs for production handover.
