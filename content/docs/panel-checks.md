# Panel Checks

## Frame and routing continuity

When frame rails are enabled, verify that internal channels do not cut through top/bottom/left/right frame rails unexpectedly.

## Routed vs scored separation

- `Routed`: channel geometry and tab bridges must be visually continuous.
- `Scored`: v-cut lines should align with intended separation edges.
- `Mixed`: check each edge behavior individually.

## Fiducials and tooling holes

- Confirm frame widths exist where fiducials/tooling holes are placed.
- Supported fiducial positions:
  - top-left
  - top-right
  - bottom-left
  - bottom-right

## Final visual checks

- Verify panel dimensions.
- Confirm tabs are present where expected.
- Export and review final panel image before release.
