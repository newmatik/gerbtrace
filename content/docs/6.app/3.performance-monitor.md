# Performance Monitor

![Performance Monitor showing system info, frame timing, and memory metrics](/images/docs/performance-monitor.png)

The Performance Monitor is accessible from the **Settings** menu (gear icon). It displays comprehensive real-time metrics to help diagnose performance issues and collect diagnostic data for support.

## Project context

The header shows the current project name, team name, your user name, and the project ID. This context is included when copying stats.

## System information

A summary of the current environment:

- **App version** – the running Gerbtrace version
- **Platform** – detected OS and whether you are using the web or desktop app
- **Browser** – browser name and version
- **Window / Screen** – window dimensions, screen resolution, and device pixel ratio
- **CPU** – number of logical cores
- **RAM** – estimated device memory (when available)
- **GPU** – WebGL renderer string
- **Network** – connection type and effective bandwidth (when available)

## Frame timing

- **FPS** – approximate frames per second for canvas rendering
- **Frame time** – milliseconds per frame
- **Long tasks** – count of frames exceeding 50 ms in a rolling 30-second window

## Memory

When the browser supports the `performance.memory` API:

- **JS Heap Used** – current JavaScript heap usage
- **JS Heap Allocated** – total allocated heap
- **JS Heap Limit** – maximum heap size

## Storage

- **Browser storage** – usage and quota from the Storage Manager API
- **Project size estimate** – approximate storage footprint of the current project

## Render cache

Internal rendering statistics:

- **Board scene cache** – cached canvas size
- **Panel tile cache** – number of cached panel tiles
- **Canvas pool** – active and idle canvas elements
- **Draw counts** – number of draw calls per frame

## Mini overlay

Toggle **Show mini overlay** to display a compact FPS / frame time / heap usage bar at the bottom of the canvas. The mini overlay stays visible while you work. Double-click it to open the full Performance Monitor.

FPS values are color-coded: green (55+ FPS), amber (30–54 FPS), red (below 30 FPS).

## Copy to clipboard

Click **Copy** to copy all performance stats as formatted text. This is useful for pasting into support tickets or bug reports alongside a [Report a Bug](/docs/app/report-a-bug) submission.

## When to use

The Performance Monitor is useful when:

- The canvas feels slow or laggy with a complex board
- You want to verify that rendering is performing efficiently
- You need to report performance data alongside a bug report
- You want to identify whether the bottleneck is GPU, memory, or network related

Close the monitor when not needed, as the overlay itself has a small performance cost.
