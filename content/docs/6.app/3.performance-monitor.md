# Performance Monitor

![Performance Monitor showing FPS and memory metrics](/images/docs/performance-monitor.png)

The Performance Monitor is accessible from the **Settings** menu (gear icon). It displays real-time rendering metrics to help diagnose performance issues with complex boards.

## Metrics

The monitor tracks:

- **FPS** – frames per second for canvas rendering
- **Memory usage** – JavaScript heap utilization
- **Canvas size** – current canvas dimensions and pixel count
- **Render time** – time per frame in milliseconds

## When to use

The Performance Monitor is useful when:

- The canvas feels slow or laggy with a complex board
- You want to verify that rendering is performing efficiently
- You need to report performance data alongside a bug report

Close the monitor when not needed, as the overlay itself has a small performance cost.
