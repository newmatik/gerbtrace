# Light & Dark Mode

Gerbtrace supports both dark and light interface themes. The default theme is dark mode. Drag the slider to compare both themes side by side.

## Switching themes

Open the **Settings** menu (gear icon in the header) and click **Light Mode** or **Dark Mode** to toggle.

The theme applies instantly to the entire interface, including the sidebar, toolbar, dialogs, and navigation. The canvas background can be controlled separately using the background toggle in the canvas toolbar.

## Canvas background

Independent of the interface theme, the canvas has its own background toggle. Click the sun/moon icon in the bottom-left canvas toolbar to switch between a dark and light canvas background. A light canvas background can be useful for inspecting certain layer combinations regardless of the interface theme.

## Persistence

Your theme preference is saved in local storage and persists across sessions and page reloads.
