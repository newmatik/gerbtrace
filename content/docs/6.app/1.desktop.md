# Desktop App

Gerbtrace is available as a native desktop application for macOS and Windows, built with [Tauri 2](https://v2.tauri.app). The desktop app bundles the same frontend as the web version but runs in a native window.

## Download

Download the latest version from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/newmatik/gerbtrace/releases):

| Platform | Format |
|---|---|
| **macOS** | `.dmg` (universal binary, Intel + Apple Silicon) |
| **Windows** | `.msi` installer or `.exe` setup |

Download links are also shown on the Gerbtrace home page.

## Auto-updates

The desktop app checks for updates automatically on launch. When a new version is available:

1. A notification appears with the release notes.
2. You can install the update immediately or defer.
3. Updates are signed and verified for security.

## What's New dialog

After installing an update, a "What's New" dialog shows the release notes for the new version.

## Window state

The app remembers your window size and position between sessions. Relaunching restores the last known state.

## Feature parity

The desktop app has full feature parity with the web version:

- All viewer, comparison, PnP, BOM, and panelization features
- Team collaboration (requires internet)
- File import and export

The primary advantages are native window management, auto-updates, and working without a browser tab.

## Error reporting

The desktop app includes Sentry integration for crash reporting. Both JavaScript errors and native Rust panics are captured. You can also submit bug reports via [Report a Bug](/docs/app/report-a-bug).
