# Report a Bug

![Report a Bug modal](/images/docs/report-bug.png)

The Report a Bug feature lets you submit feedback directly from within Gerbtrace. Access it from the **Settings** menu (gear icon) or from the bug icon in the app header.

## Submitting a report

The bug report modal includes:

- **Email** (optional) – provide your email if you want a follow-up response
- **Description** – describe what happened, what you expected, and any steps to reproduce

Click **Submit** to send the report. Submissions are sent to Sentry and tagged as user feedback, where the development team can review them.

## What gets sent

Bug reports include:

- Your description and email (if provided)
- The current page URL and app version
- Browser and OS information
- Any recent error context from the Sentry session

No project data, files, or personal information beyond what you type is included.

## When to use

Use the bug report form for:

- Unexpected errors or crashes
- Rendering issues on the canvas
- Import failures or data corruption
- UI problems or confusing behavior

For feature requests or general questions, use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/newmatik/gerbtrace/issues) page instead.
