# Exports

![Downloads dropdown showing export options](/images/docs/exports-dropdown.png)

The **Downloads** button in the project header provides access to all export features. Click it to see the available options.

## Export Image

![Export Image modal](/images/docs/export-image-modal.png)

Export the current canvas view as an image file.

- **Format** – PNG or SVG
- **Resolution** – configurable DPI for print-quality output
- **Scope** – exports exactly what is visible on the canvas, including active layers, component overlays, and rendering mode

Use this to generate assembly prints, board images for documentation, or quote visuals.

## Export Panel Image

![Export Panel Image modal](/images/docs/export-panel-image-modal.png)

Export the panelized board layout as an image. This requires a panel configuration in the [Panel](/docs/viewer/panel) tab.

- **Format** – PNG or SVG
- **Resolution** – configurable DPI
- **Content** – the full panel layout including frame, fiducials, tooling holes, and routing channels

## Download Gerber

Download the imported Gerber and drill files as a ZIP package. This re-packages the original files for handover or archival.

## Export PnP

![Export PnP modal](/images/docs/export-pnp-modal.png)

Export Pick and Place data for production.

- **Convention** – Mycronic, IPC-7351, or IEC 61188-7 rotation convention
- **Format** – TSV or CSV
- **Side** – combined, top only, bottom only, or separate files
- **Components** – SMD, THT, or both
- **Fields** – select which columns to include

Exported data applies all overrides (rotation corrections, DNP flags, package mappings, assembly types) and converts to the selected convention.

## Export DXF

![Export DXF modal with layer selection and variant options](/images/docs/export-dxf.png)

Export Gerber layers as DXF files for import into mechanical CAD tools or EDA software.

- **Output** – **Combined DXF** (all selected layers in a single file) or **ZIP per layer** (one DXF per selected layer in a ZIP archive)
- **DXF variant** – **POLYLINE (R12)** for maximum compatibility with older tools, or **LWPOLYLINE (R2000+)** for smaller file sizes with modern CAD applications
- **Layers** – select which Gerber layers to include using the checklist, with Select All / None buttons

The summary line at the bottom shows the number of selected layers, the output mode, and the DXF variant. The exporter converts Gerber primitives (arcs, lines, regions, flashes) into DXF entities with layer names matching the source file names.

## Export JPSys

![Export JPSys modal for jet print program generation](/images/docs/paste-export-jpsys.png)

Export a JPSys JSON program file for Mycronic jet printers. This requires paste layer data. The export is also accessible from the [Paste](/docs/viewer/paste) tab when in jet print mode.

- **Ejector Type** – AG04 (Standard) or AR02 (Fine-Pitch)
- **Volume %** – 90%, 100%, or 130% paste volume
- **Program Name** – auto-generated from the project name and settings, or enter a custom name
- **Machine Type** – target machine identifier (default: MY500_S3)
- **Stencil Height** – virtual stencil height in micrometers (50–300, default: 127)
- **Deposit Shrink Factor** – ratio to account for paste spread after deposition (0.80–1.00, default: 0.96)

The info box shows the number of paste pads detected and the ejector media type. The exported JSON file follows the JPSys format documented in the [Jet Printing](/docs/reference/jet-printing) reference.
