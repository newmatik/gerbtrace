# Exports

![Downloads dropdown showing export options](/images/docs/exports-dropdown.png)

The **Downloads** button in the project header provides access to all export features. Click it to see the available options.

## Export Image

![Export Image modal](/images/docs/export-image-modal.png)

Export the current canvas view as an image file.

- **Format** – PNG or SVG
- **Resolution** – configurable DPI for print-quality output
- **Scope** – exports exactly what is visible on the canvas, including active layers, component overlays, and rendering mode

Use this to generate assembly prints, board images for documentation, or quote visuals.

## Export Panel Image

![Export Panel Image modal](/images/docs/export-panel-image-modal.png)

Export the panelized board layout as an image. This requires a panel configuration in the [Panel](/docs/viewer/panel) tab.

- **Format** – PNG or SVG
- **Resolution** – configurable DPI
- **Content** – the full panel layout including frame, fiducials, tooling holes, and routing channels

## Download Gerber

Download the imported Gerber and drill files as a ZIP package. This re-packages the original files for handover or archival.

## Export PnP

![Export PnP modal](/images/docs/export-pnp-modal.png)

Export Pick and Place data for production.

- **Convention** – Mycronic, IPC-7351, or IEC 61188-7 rotation convention
- **Format** – TSV or CSV
- **Side** – combined, top only, bottom only, or separate files
- **Components** – SMD, THT, or both
- **Fields** – select which columns to include

Exported data applies all overrides (rotation corrections, DNP flags, package mappings, assembly types) and converts to the selected convention.
