# Package Manager

![Package Manager showing library packages](/images/docs/package-manager.png)

The Package Manager is a dedicated page for browsing, searching, and managing component packages. Access it from the **Settings** menu (gear icon) in any project.

## Package types

Toggle between two package categories:

- **SMD (TPSys)** – surface-mount packages using the TPSys parametric system
- **THT Generic** – through-hole packages with visual pin/body definitions

## Library sources

Filter packages by source library using the button row:

- **All Libraries** – show packages from all sources
- **DigiKey KiCad** – packages parsed from DigiKey's KiCad library
- **KiCad** – packages from KiCad's official library
- **Gerbtrace** – core Newmatik-maintained packages
- **Team Library** – custom packages created by your team

## Scope

Toggle between **Team** and **Space** scope using the scope selector:

- **Team** – shows packages available to all team members
- **Space** – shows packages scoped to a specific space, selectable via a dropdown

Each package displays a scope badge (**Built-in**, **Team**, or **Space**) indicating where it is stored.

## Copy to Space

When viewing built-in or team packages, use the **Copy to Space** action to copy a package into a specific space. Space packages are only available to members of that space, which is useful for customer-specific footprints or project-scoped variants.

## Searching

Use the search box to find packages by name or alias. The search matches against the canonical package name and all registered aliases.

## Package type filter

Filter by TPSys package type classification (Chip 2-pole, Standard, QFP/QFN, BGA, Outline, Generic, etc.) using the dropdown.

## Package details

Click a package in the list to see its details in the preview pane:

- Visual footprint rendering
- Package type and dimensions
- Lead geometry and pad sizes
- Alias list

## Team packages

Team Library packages are stored in your team's Supabase database. Team admins and editors can create custom packages that are available to all team members. Team packages appear alongside built-in library packages in the [SMD](/docs/viewer/smd) and [THT](/docs/viewer/tht) package assignment dropdowns.

See [Package Library](/docs/guides/package-library) for more on how packages are structured and matched.
