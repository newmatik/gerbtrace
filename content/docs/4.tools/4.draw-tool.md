# Draw Tool

![Draw tool active with shape toolbar and snap preview](/images/docs/draw-tool.png)

The Draw Tool lets you add geometry directly to Gerber and Excellon layers. Use it to add missing features, place fiducials, draw board outlines, or insert drill holes without leaving the viewer.

## Activating the tool

Select the **Draw** tool from the canvas toolbar. The draw editor bar appears at the top of the canvas with layer selection, shape tools, and configuration options.

## Target layer

Choose which layer to draw on using the **Layer** dropdown. Each layer shows its color swatch and file name. The available shape tools adjust based on the layer type:

- **Gerber layers** – Line, Rectangle, Circle, Text
- **Excellon (drill) layers** – Drill

## Shape tools

### Line

Click and drag to draw a line segment. The stroke width is configurable.

### Rectangle

Click and drag to draw a rectangle. Toggle between **Fill** (solid region) and **Stroke** (outline only). In stroke mode the width is configurable.

### Circle

Click and drag to draw a circle defined by center and radius. Supports fill and stroke modes.

### Text

Click to place text on the layer. Enter the text content and height (mm) in the toolbar before clicking.

### Drill

Available on Excellon layers. Click to place a drill hit. Set the diameter (mm) in the toolbar before clicking.

## Fill and stroke

For Gerber shapes (Line, Rectangle, Circle), toggle between:

- **Fill** – draws a solid Gerber region
- **Stroke** – draws an outline with configurable width (mm)

## Snap system

Toggle **Snap** in the toolbar to enable snapping. Two snap modes work together:

- **Grid snap** (green indicator) – snaps to the configured grid spacing
- **Object snap** (yellow indicator) – snaps to existing pad centers, endpoints, and geometry centers on visible layers

A snap indicator with a label appears at the cursor when snapping is active.

## Precise mode

Enable **Precise** in the toolbar to enter exact dimensions before placing a shape:

- **Rectangle** – enter width and height (mm), then click to place
- **Circle** – enter radius (mm), then click to place
- **Line** – enter length (mm), then click to place

The preview shows a ghost outline at the cursor so you can verify the size before committing.

## Quick placement

Two preset buttons provide one-click placement of common features:

- **Fiducial** – places a 1 mm copper dot with a 3 mm solder mask clear and a 2 mm paste mask opening, matching the standard fiducial specification
- **BC (Barcode)** – places a barcode box outline with configurable size

## Dimension labels

While drawing, live dimension labels show the size of the shape being created (width, height, radius, or length in mm). Dimensions smaller than 1 mm are displayed in micrometers.

## Undo

Press **Escape** while not actively drawing to undo the last committed shape. You can also press **Escape** during a drag operation to cancel the current shape without committing it.
