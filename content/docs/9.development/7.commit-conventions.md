# Commit Conventions

All commits in the Gerbtrace repository follow a consistent format. This page documents the conventions for commit messages, release notes, and hotfixes.

## Commit types

Every commit subject starts with one of these prefixes:

| Prefix | When to use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `Release vX.Y.Z` | Version bump and tag commit | `Release v1.2.0` |
| `hotfix:` | Bug fix or patch pushed between releases | `hotfix: fix BOM pricing for EUR currency` |
| `feat:` | New feature or significant enhancement | `feat: add DXF export for panel outlines` |
| `chore:` | Housekeeping (dependencies, config, CI) | `chore: sync package-lock.json` |
| `ci:` | CI/CD workflow changes | `ci: add manual deploy trigger` |

## Subject line rules

- Maximum 72 characters.
- Use imperative mood: "fix crash" not "fixed crash" or "fixes crash".
- Lowercase after the prefix colon: `hotfix: fix BOM crash`, not `hotfix: Fix BOM crash`.
- No trailing period.
- Be specific: `hotfix: fix Elexess API crash on empty response`, not `hotfix: fix crash`.

## Body

- Separate from the subject with a blank line.
- Optional for hotfixes and chores. Recommended for features and releases.
- Wrap at 72 characters.
- Explain **why**, not **what** (the diff shows what).

## Release commits

A release commit is created when bumping the version and tagging a new release.

**Subject:** `Release vX.Y.Z` (no extra text after the version number).

**Body:** The release notes content — the same flat bullet list that appears on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/newmatik/gerbtrace/releases) page and in the desktop app's "What's New" dialog.

Example:

```
Release v1.1.0

- New modular viewer workflow with dedicated Files, PCB, Panel, Components, BOM, and Docs tabs
- BOM editing with focused details panel, inline field highlighting, and pricing visibility
- Team projects now support assignee selection with enforced access rules
```

## Hotfix commits

A hotfix is any bug fix, patch, or correction pushed between releases. Hotfixes land directly on the release branch or on `main` after a release.

**Subject:** `hotfix: <concise description of the fix>`

**Body:** Optional. Include a 1-2 sentence explanation when the subject alone isn't self-explanatory.

Example:

```
hotfix: fix magic link redirect in Tauri desktop app

Switch Supabase client to implicit auth flow to prevent PKCE code-verifier
mismatches when magic links open in a different browser context.
```

## Release notes

Release notes are written at the time the version tag is pushed. They appear in three places:

1. The [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/newmatik/gerbtrace/releases) page.
2. The Tauri desktop updater (`latest.json` body field).
3. The in-app "What's New" dialog shown after a desktop auto-update.

### Format

- Use a flat bullet list. No headings, no categories, no sub-lists.
- Each bullet is a single concise sentence describing one user-facing change.
- Focus on features and bug fixes that affect users. Omit internal refactors, CI changes, and dependency bumps unless they fix a visible problem.
- No emojis.
- No "What's Changed" heading or auto-generated contributor lists.
- For the initial release, start with "Initial release." before the bullets.
- Keep the text short enough to read comfortably in a small modal dialog.

### Title

Use the bare version number: `v1.2.0`. Do not prefix with the product name.

### Example

```
v1.1.1

- Complete in-app documentation hub with guides and references
- New Summary panel and file table preview for faster board review
- Improved PCB, BOM, and Pick and Place workflows
- Paste settings and project file import preferences now saved consistently
- Fix PCB field and viewer UI issues
```

## Attribution

- Never include `Co-authored-by` trailers for AI tools (Cursor, CodeRabbit, Codex, or any other AI agent).
- Never reference AI tools in commit messages, PR descriptions, or release notes.
- Human co-author trailers are allowed when explicitly provided.
