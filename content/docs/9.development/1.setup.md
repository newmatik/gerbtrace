# Development Setup

This guide covers everything you need to start developing Gerbtrace locally.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20 or later
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (only required for desktop app development)

## Getting started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/newmatik/gerbtrace.git
cd gerbtrace

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the web development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root for Supabase connection:

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://gqrnlnlfidighosujpdb.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
```

For local-only development (no team features), these can be omitted. Local projects use IndexedDB and do not require a backend.

## Desktop development

The desktop app is built with [Tauri 2](https://v2.tauri.app). Make sure Rust is installed via [rustup](https://rustup.rs).

```bash
# Start Tauri development (launches native window with hot reload)
npm run tauri:dev

# Build desktop app for your current platform
npm run tauri:build
```

Tauri development mode runs the Nuxt dev server and opens a native window pointing to it. Changes to Vue files hot-reload in the desktop window just like in the browser.

## Production build

```bash
# Generate static web app
npm run generate
# Output: .output/public/
```

The generated static files can be deployed to any static hosting provider.
