# Conversation

![Conversation panel with threaded messages](/images/docs/conversation.png)

The Conversation tab provides a threaded discussion space within each team project. Use it to coordinate reviews, flag issues, and keep project-related communication alongside the data.

## Opening the panel

In any team project, click the **Conversation** tab in the viewer to open the panel. Messages load in chronological order and update in real time as other team members post.

## Posting messages

![Message composer with formatting toolbar](/images/docs/conversation-input.png)

Type your message in the composer at the bottom of the panel. The formatting toolbar supports:

- **Bold**, **Italic**, **Underline**, **Strikethrough**
- **Code** (inline)
- **Links**
- **Lists**

Press **Enter** to send. The message appears immediately for all team members viewing the project.

## Mentions

Type `@` followed by a team member's name to mention them. An autocomplete dropdown shows matching members. Mentioned users receive a notification in their [Inbox](/docs/collaboration/notifications).

## Project references

In addition to people, the autocomplete supports referencing project items:

- **Files** – reference imported Gerber, drill, or document files
- **BOM lines** – link to a specific BOM entry
- **PnP components** – reference a Pick and Place component
- **Documents** – link to an uploaded PDF

References render as clickable chips in the message, making it easy for readers to navigate to the relevant data.

## Threaded replies

Click **Reply** on any message to start a thread. Replies appear indented below the parent message, keeping discussions organized without cluttering the main timeline.

## File attachments

Click the attachment button in the composer to attach files (up to 10 MB per file). Attachments are stored alongside the project and accessible to all team members. Attached files appear as download links below the message body.

## Editing and deleting

Hover over your own message to reveal the edit (pencil) and delete (trash) icons. Admins can delete any message. Editing opens an inline textarea with Save and Cancel buttons. Deleting a parent message also removes its replies.

## Real-time updates

Messages, edits, and deletions propagate in real time via Supabase Realtime. There is no need to refresh the panel manually, though a **Refresh** button is available in the header for convenience.
