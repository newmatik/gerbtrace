# Files

![Files tab showing imported project files grouped by type](/images/docs/files-panel.png)

The Files tab is where you import and manage all project data. Drag and drop a ZIP package or individual files onto the panel, and Gerbtrace auto-detects file types and layer classifications.

## Importing files

Drop files onto the import area or use the file picker. Gerbtrace accepts:

- **Gerber files** (.gbr, .ger, .gtl, .gbl, etc.) – auto-classified to layer types
- **Drill files** (.drl, .xln, .exc) – plated and non-plated
- **Pick and Place** (.csv, .tsv, .txt) – component placement data
- **BOM** (.csv, .xlsx, .xls) – bill of materials
- **PDF documents** – schematics, drawings, datasheets

ZIP archives are extracted automatically and each file is classified individually.

## File groups

Imported files are organized into collapsible groups:

- **Gerber Files** – copper, mask, silk, paste, and outline layers
- **Drill Files** – through-hole and via drill data
- **Pick and Place** – SMD and THT placement files
- **Bill of Materials** – BOM data files
- **Documents** – PDF files categorized as drawings, schematics, or datasheets

Each group shows a count badge and can be collapsed or expanded.

## Layer classification

Every Gerber file has a layer type assignment (Top Copper, Bottom Solder Mask, Outline, etc.). Gerbtrace assigns types automatically based on file names and extensions. If the auto-detection is wrong, use the dropdown next to each file to change the type manually.

## File actions

Each file row has an actions menu with options to:

- Download the original file
- Remove the file from the project
- Reassign the layer type

## File preview

Click a file to see a preview in the right panel. Gerber and drill files render a visual preview; PDF documents show the first page.

## Lock

In team projects, the **Unlocked / Locked** toggle in the top-right corner controls whether files can be imported, deleted, or reordered. Locking the Files page prevents accidental changes while other team members are working on the project.
