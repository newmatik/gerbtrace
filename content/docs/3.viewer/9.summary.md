# Summary

![Summary tab with assembly overview and warnings](/images/docs/summary-panel.png)

The Summary tab provides a comprehensive overview of the assembly at a glance. Use it to verify project completeness before production handover.

## Component overview

The top row shows key counts:

- **SMD** – total surface-mount components (top/bottom breakdown)
- **THT** – total through-hole components (top/bottom breakdown)
- **DNP** – components marked Do Not Populate
- **BOM Lines** – total BOM lines by type (SMD, THT, MNT)

## PCB information

A card showing the board parameters configured in the [PCB](/docs/viewer/pcb) tab:

- Board dimensions and layer count
- Material, surface finish, copper weight, and thickness
- Board area
- Count of unmatched components (with link to resolve)

## Placement categories (SMD)

SMD components grouped by placement speed category:

- **Chip (fast)** – passive chip components (0201, 0402, 0603, etc.)
- **Standard** – standard IC packages (SOIC, SOT, etc.)
- **QFP/QFN** – fine-pitch quad packages
- **Other** – all remaining SMD components

Each category shows the count and percentage.

## Wave soldering

A heuristic check indicating whether the board is suitable for wave soldering:

- **Suitable** – all THT components are on one side
- **Conditionally suitable** – some restrictions apply
- **Not suitable** – THT on both sides or other blockers

The check considers component placement and board geometry.

## Hand solder estimate

Estimated solder points per board based on THT pin counts, with average pins per component shown.

## Assembly warnings

Flags for production considerations:

- Unmatched library packages
- Mixed technology (SMD + THT) requiring multiple process steps
- BGA components (X-ray inspection required)
- Fine-pitch components
- Double-sided SMD placement
