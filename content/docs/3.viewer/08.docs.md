# Docs

![Docs tab showing project documents](/images/docs/docs-tab.png)

The Docs tab displays PDF documents imported into the project. Documents are categorized by type and can be previewed directly in the browser.

## Document types

PDF files imported via the [Files](/docs/viewer/files) tab are auto-classified into categories:

- **Drawings** – mechanical drawings, assembly prints, fabrication notes
- **Schematics** – circuit schematics
- **Datasheets** – component datasheets and specifications

You can change the category in the Files tab using the layer type dropdown.

## Document preview

Click a document in the list to open a preview in the main area. The preview renders the PDF inline so you can review drawings and schematics without leaving Gerbtrace.

## Usage

The Docs tab provides a convenient reference library alongside your manufacturing data. Having schematics and drawings accessible in the same project as the Gerber and BOM data streamlines review workflows.
