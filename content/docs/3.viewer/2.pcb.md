# PCB

![PCB tab showing board parameters and layer management](/images/docs/pcb-parameters.png)

The PCB tab combines board parameter configuration with layer management and canvas tools. This is where you define the physical properties of your board and inspect the rendered Gerber data.

## Board parameters

Configure the physical properties of your PCB at the top of the sidebar:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| **Size X / Size Y** | Board dimensions in mm (auto-detected from outline) |
| **Layers** | Copper layer count: 1L, 2L, 4L, 6L, 8L, 10L, 20L |
| **Material** | FR4, IMS Aluminium, Flex (Polyimide), or Rigid-Flex |
| **Surface Finish** | ENIG (Ni/Au), HAL (HASL), or OSP |
| **Copper Weight** | Outer copper thickness (1 oz / 35 um, 2 oz / 70 um) |
| **Thickness** | Overall PCB thickness |
| **Solder Mask Color** | Green, black, blue, red, white, purple, or brown |
| **Panelization** | Single PCB or Panelized PCB mode |

Board size and layer count are auto-detected from imported Gerber data when possible. These parameters feed into the [Pricing](/docs/viewer/pricing) calculations and the [Summary](/docs/viewer/summary).

## Layer management

Below the board parameters, each imported Gerber and drill file is listed with:

- **Color swatch** – click to change the rendering color
- **Layer type dropdown** – reassign the layer classification
- **Visibility toggle** (eye icon) – show or hide individual layers
- **Group toggles** – show or hide all layers in a section at once

## Rendering modes

The toolbar offers two rendering modes:

### Standard mode

All visible layers are composited on a Canvas 2D view with configurable colors. This is the default for inspecting individual layers.

### Realistic mode

A photo-like rendering that simulates the physical PCB appearance. Realistic mode combines copper, solder mask, silkscreen, and paste layers with the configured surface finish and mask color. The **All**, **Top**, and **Bot** filter buttons control which side is shown.

## Canvas tools

The toolbar provides these tools:

- **Cursor** – default selection and pan mode
- **Measure** – click two points to measure distance in mm
- **Info** – hover or click to inspect layer elements and coordinates
- **Delete** – remove individual drawing primitives from a layer
- **Crop** – clip rendering to the board outline

## Canvas controls

- **Pan** – click and drag to move the view
- **Zoom** – mouse wheel or +/- buttons
- **Fit to view** – auto-zoom to show the entire board
- **Rotation** – rotate the view in 90-degree increments
- **Grid** – toggle a reference grid overlay
- **Background** – switch between dark and light canvas backgrounds

## Lock

The **Unlocked / Locked** toggle prevents changes to board parameters and layer settings. Use this in team projects to avoid accidental modifications while others are reviewing the data.
