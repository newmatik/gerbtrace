# THT

![THT tab with through-hole component list and board overlay](/images/docs/tht-components.png)

The THT tab manages through-hole component placement data. It shares the same core functionality as the [SMD](/docs/viewer/smd) tab but adds assembly type assignment for THT-specific production workflows.

## Component list

The left panel shows all THT components with the same columns as SMD (Ref, Rot, Pol, Value, CAD Pkg, Package) plus an **Assembly Type** selector.

## Assembly types

Each THT component can be assigned an assembly type:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Wave** | Wave soldering (default) |
| **Hand** | Manual hand soldering |
| **Mounting** | Mechanical mounting (press-fit, screws) |
| **Coating** | Conformal coating operation |
| **Cable** | Cable assembly |
| **Loose** | Delivered loose (not assembled) |

Assembly types are included in PnP exports and reflected in the [Summary](/docs/viewer/summary) hand solder breakdown.

## Filters, editing, and groups

The THT tab supports the same filters (Polarized, DNP, Edited, Unmatched), inline editing (rotation, polarity, DNP), component groups, and convention/alignment settings as the [SMD](/docs/viewer/smd) tab.

## Visualization

THT components render on the board canvas with body outlines, pin geometry, and drill holes. The same bidirectional highlighting applies – click a component to locate it on the board.

## Lock

The **Unlocked / Locked** toggle prevents component edits in team projects.
