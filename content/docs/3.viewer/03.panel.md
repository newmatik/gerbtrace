# Panel

![Panel tab showing a 3x3 panelized layout](/images/docs/panel-overview.png)

The Panel tab lets you define multi-up panel layouts for PCB production. Configure the grid arrangement, frame rails, fiducials, tooling holes, routing channels, tabs, and support bars – all with a live canvas preview.

## Suggestions

Click **Generate** to compute panel layout suggestions based on your configured preferred and maximum panel envelope (set in [Team Settings](/docs/collaboration/team-settings)). The suggestion engine proposes grid configurations that maximize board count while respecting size limits. Click **Auto-panelize** to apply a suggestion.

## General settings

- **Count X / Count Y** – number of boards in columns and rows
- **Rotation** – rotate individual boards (0 or 90 degrees)

The panel dimensions update in real time as you adjust values.

## Frame

Enable a frame around the panel for handling and machine registration:

- **Per-side widths** – independent frame widths for top, bottom, left, and right edges
- **Corner radius** – rounded corners on the frame

## Support bars

Support bars run between columns or rows to add structural rigidity:

- **Column rail / Row rail widths** – set rail width independently
- **Selective placement** – enable bars between specific columns and rows

## Fiducials

Fiducial marks are used by pick-and-place machines for alignment:

- **Diameter** – fiducial pad size
- **Position** – top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right (any combination)

## Tooling holes

Tooling holes allow mechanical registration in fixtures:

- **Diameter** and **Offset** from panel edges
- **Position** – configurable per corner

## Panel connections

### Separation type

Choose how boards are separated:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Routed** | Routing channels with tab bridges |
| **V-Cut** | V-score lines for break-apart |
| **Mixed** | Different separation methods per edge |

Set the routing tool diameter and configure separation type independently for each edge (top, bottom, left, right).

### Tabs

Tabs hold boards together within routed panels. Configure:

- **Tab count** per edge
- **Tab width**
- **Mouse bite perforation** – hole diameter and spacing for easy breakaway

Tab positions are managed visually on the canvas using the Move, Add, and Delete toolbar buttons.

## Component overlay

Enable **SMD** and **THT** component overlays on the panel view to verify that components do not conflict with tabs, routing channels, or frame elements.

## Canvas controls

The panel canvas shows the full layout in real time. All sidebar edits immediately reflect on the canvas. Use the **Show Danger** button to highlight the keep-out inset zone near board edges.

## Panel size warnings

If the panel exceeds your configured maximum size limits, a warning appears in the status bar. Configure preferred and maximum panel sizes in [Team Settings](/docs/collaboration/team-settings).
