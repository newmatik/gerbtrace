# Paste

The Paste tab lets you configure and preview solder paste application settings. Gerbtrace supports both traditional stencil printing and modern jet printing modes.

## Stencil mode

In stencil mode, solder paste is applied through a fixed laser-cut steel stencil. The paste layer from your Gerber data defines the aperture geometry. The viewer displays the paste layer as-is from the imported files.

## Jet print mode

Jet print mode is designed for stencil-free paste deposition systems like the Mycronic MY600. Instead of fixed apertures, the system deposits controlled micro-droplets that build up the final paste deposit.

### Dot configuration

- **Dot Diameter** – size of individual paste droplets (range: 0.33 – 0.52 mm)
- **Dot Spacing** – distance between adjacent droplets (range: 0.35 – 1.00 mm)
- **Dot Pattern** – Grid or Hex arrangement
- **Dynamic Dot Control** – auto-shrink dots on small pads
- **Highlight Dots** – toggle dot visibility overlay

The canvas shows a visual preview of how paste dots are arranged on each pad, giving a visual check of coverage and density before programming the machine.

### When to use jet printing

Jet printing is particularly useful for prototyping, frequent PCB revisions, complex mixed-technology boards, and fine-pitch components (QFN, BGA) that benefit from per-pad volume control.

See [Jet Printing](/docs/reference/jet-printing) for a detailed technical overview of the MY600 system.

## Switching modes

Toggle between Stencil and Jetprint using the radio buttons at the top of the Paste sidebar. The canvas preview updates immediately.
