# BOM

![BOM tab showing component lines with detail pane](/images/docs/bom-panel.png)

The BOM tab lets you import, edit, and enrich Bill of Materials data. It supports multiple manufacturers per line, customer-provided component tracking, and live pricing integration via the Elexess API.

## BOM line list

The left panel shows all BOM lines with:

- **References** – component designators (C1, C2, R1, etc.)
- **Description** – component description
- **Type badge** – SMD, THT, or MNT
- **Quantity** – reference count with board multiplier
- **Unit price and total** – from pricing data when available

Click any line to open its detail pane on the right.

## Filters

Quick-filter buttons in the toolbar:

- **SMD / THT** – filter by mounting type
- **DNP** – Do Not Populate components
- **CP** – customer-provided components
- **No Mfr** – lines missing a manufacturer
- **No Price** – lines without pricing data
- **Missing PnP** – lines with no matching PnP reference

## Quantity tiers

The quantity selector at the top sets the production quantity. Multiple quantity tiers can be added (e.g., 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000). Pricing calculations update for each tier. Remove tiers with the X button or add new ones by typing in the input field.

## Detail pane

Clicking a BOM line opens the detail pane with editable fields:

- **Description** and **Comment**
- **Type** (SMD, THT, Mounting, Other)
- **Package** footprint name
- **Customer Item** number
- **Qty / board** count
- **Customer Provided** and **DNP** toggles
- **References** – add or remove component designators

## Manufacturers

Each BOM line can have multiple manufacturer entries. Each entry includes:

- **Manufacturer name**
- **Manufacturer part number** (MPN)
- **Refresh pricing** button
- **Remove manufacturer** button

Click **+ Add manufacturer** to add alternatives.

## Supplier pricing

![Expanded suppliers section showing distributor pricing](/images/docs/bom-suppliers.png)

When the [Elexess API](/docs/collaboration/team-settings#elexess-api-credentials) is configured in Team Settings, Gerbtrace fetches live distributor pricing for each manufacturer part number. Expand the suppliers section under a manufacturer to see:

- **Supplier** name (Weltron, Anglia, Abacus, TME, LCSC, Farnell, etc.)
- **Stock** – available quantity
- **MOQ** – minimum order quantity
- **Unit price** – per-component cost
- **Total** – extended price for the selected quantity

The best price is highlighted in green. Click **Fetch Prices** in the toolbar to fetch pricing for all lines at once, or use the refresh button on individual manufacturers.

## Copy CP List

The **Copy CP List** button in the toolbar header copies a formatted list of all customer-provided component references to the clipboard. This is useful for sending to the customer to confirm which components they need to supply.

## Sorting

Use the **Ref** and **Price** sort buttons to order BOM lines by designator (alphabetical) or by total cost (to identify cost drivers).

## BOM and PnP cross-referencing

When both BOM and PnP data are loaded, Gerbtrace surfaces mismatches:

- References in BOM but missing from PnP
- References in PnP but missing from BOM
- Quantity discrepancies

The **Missing PnP** filter highlights lines with cross-reference issues.

## Lock

The **Unlocked / Locked** toggle prevents BOM line edits, manufacturer changes, and pricing fetches. Use this in team projects when the BOM has been verified and approved.
