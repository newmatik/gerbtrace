# Pricing

![Pricing tab with quantity tier breakdown](/images/docs/pricing-table.png)

The Pricing tab provides cost estimates for fabrication and assembly based on board parameters, BOM pricing, and quantity tiers. Use it to generate quick quotes or compare cost at different volumes.

## Quantity tiers

Add quantity tiers (e.g., 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000) using the input field at the top. Each tier shows a row in the pricing table with:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **QTY** | Number of boards |
| **Assembly** | Assembly cost per piece |
| **BOM** | Component cost per piece (from [BOM](/docs/viewer/bom) pricing) |
| **PCB** | Fabrication cost per piece |
| **Markup** | Configurable percentage markup |
| **Sum / PC** | Total per piece |
| **Total** | Grand total for the tier |

The selected quantity row is highlighted.

## NRE / Tooling

Below the tier table, a section shows one-time costs:

- **PCB tooling** – fabrication setup cost
- **PCBA tooling** – assembly setup cost
- **Total tooling** – combined NRE

## Grand total

The bottom section shows the selected quantity with the grand total including tooling costs.

## Data sources

Pricing draws from several project inputs:

- **Board parameters** from the [PCB](/docs/viewer/pcb) tab (size, layers, material, finish)
- **Component pricing** from the [BOM](/docs/viewer/bom) tab (Elexess API data)
- **Panel configuration** from the [Panel](/docs/viewer/panel) tab (boards per panel)

## Currency

Prices display in the team's configured currency (EUR or USD). Change the currency in [Team Settings](/docs/collaboration/team-settings).

## Lock

The **Unlocked / Locked** toggle prevents changes to quantity tiers. Use this when the pricing has been reviewed and should not be modified.
