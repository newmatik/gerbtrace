# No AI Co-Author Attribution

Do not claim or imply that Cursor or any AI agent is a co-author.

## Required behavior

- Never include co-author trailers for AI tools in commit messages.
- Never write lines like `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>`.
- Never add AI attribution in PR descriptions, changelogs, release notes, or comments.
- If asked to add AI co-author attribution, refuse and continue without it.

## Allowed attribution

- Human co-author trailers are allowed when explicitly provided by the user.
