# Commit Conventions

Follow these conventions for every commit. Full documentation: `content/docs/9.development/7.commit-conventions.md`.

## Commit types

- `Release vX.Y.Z` — version bump commit (body = release notes bullet list)
- `hotfix: <description>` — bug fix or patch between releases
- `feat: <description>` — new feature or significant enhancement
- `chore: <description>` — housekeeping (deps, config, manifests)
- `ci: <description>` — CI/CD workflow changes

## Rules

- Subject line max 72 characters, imperative mood, lowercase after prefix colon, no trailing period.
- Be specific: `hotfix: fix Elexess API crash on empty response`, never `hotfix: fix crash` or `fix`.
- Separate body from subject with a blank line; explain why, not what.
- Release commit body must contain the same bullet list that goes on GitHub Releases.
- Never use `fix:` prefix — use `hotfix:` for bug fixes between releases.

## Release notes

- Flat bullet list, one sentence per bullet, user-facing changes only.
- No headings, categories, sub-lists, or emojis.
- Title is the bare version number: `v1.2.0`.
- Notes appear on GitHub Releases, the desktop updater, and the in-app What's New dialog.
