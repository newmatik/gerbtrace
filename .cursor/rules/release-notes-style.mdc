# Release Notes Style

Every tagged release must have release notes on GitHub. Keep them minimalistic and user-oriented.

## Title format

Use the bare version number as the release title:

```
v1.0.X
```

Do not prefix with the product name (no "Gerbtrace v1.0.X").

## Body format

- Use a flat bullet list. No headings, no categories, no sub-lists.
- Each bullet is a single concise sentence describing one user-facing change.
- Focus on new features and bug fixes that affect users. Omit internal refactors, CI changes, and dependency bumps unless they fix a visible problem.
- No emojis.
- No "What's Changed" heading or auto-generated contributor lists.
- For the initial release (v1.0.0), start with a one-line "Initial release." before the bullets.

## Example

```
- Pick and Place file support with component visualization on the board
- Component panel with search and bidirectional highlighting
- Fix Windows desktop build
```

## When to write release notes

Write release notes at the time the version tag is pushed and the GitHub Release is created. The notes are consumed by:

1. The GitHub Releases page.
2. The Tauri desktop updater (`latest.json` body field).
3. The in-app "What's New" dialog shown after a desktop update.

Keep the text short enough to read comfortably in a small modal dialog.
