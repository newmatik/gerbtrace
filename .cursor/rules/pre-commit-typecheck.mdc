# Pre-commit Typecheck

A `simple-git-hooks` pre-commit hook runs `pnpm run typecheck` before every commit. Commits are blocked if the typecheck fails.

## Rules

- Never introduce type errors. Run `pnpm run typecheck` to verify before suggesting a commit.
- If you change types, composables, or component props, verify typecheck still passes.
- Do not bypass the hook with `--no-verify` unless the user explicitly asks.
- Fix type errors in the same change that introduces them — do not leave them for a follow-up.
