# Nuxt UI Form Controls Preferred

Use Nuxt UI form controls for consistency across the app.

## Rule

- Prefer Nuxt UI controls over native HTML controls whenever possible:
  - `USelect` / `USelectMenu` instead of `<select>` / `<option>`
  - `URadioGroup` instead of native radio groups
  - `UCheckbox` / `UCheckboxGroup` instead of native checkboxes
  - `USwitch` for boolean toggle-style settings
- Keep native controls only when a Nuxt UI component cannot reasonably satisfy behavior, accessibility, or performance needs.

## Pick and Place selectors

- SMD/THT package selectors should be searchable (autocomplete behavior).
- Option labels should include package source context (for example library/source name).

## Notes

- Keep value payloads unchanged unless the feature explicitly requires a data-model change.
- Follow existing Nuxt UI patterns in nearby components for size, variant, and density.
